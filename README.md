# RFID-Voting
RFID Based Voting Machine

In this project we designd a voting machine which only counts authenticated votes. This is done by using RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tags.  Here we are going to write a program for ATMEGA for allowing only authorized RFID tag holders to vote.

### Components Required

Hardware: ATMEGA32, power supply (5v), AVR-ISP PROGRAMMER, JHD_162ALCD (16x2LCD), 100uF capacitor (connected across power supply), button (five pieces), 10Kâ„¦ resistor (five pieces), 100nF capacitor (five pieces), LED (two pieces), EM-18(RFID reader module).
 
Software: Atmel studio 6.1, progisp or flash magic.
